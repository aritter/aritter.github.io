    I am always looking for ambitious and highly motivated students to work with.
    If you are currently enrolled at Ohio State and are interested in doing research with me on natural language processing,
    information extraction, machine learning, and/or social media analysis, feel free to send a short email with 1) your C.V. or resume
    and 2) a brief description of what areas you are interested in and what you are hoping to get out of our interaction.
    Generally I like to work with students who have some prior experience with
    machine learning and/or natural language processing; having some previous interaction with me in a class
    is a huge plus.  Students outside OSU are welcome to send email as well, but admissions decisions are made by committee.
    I get many of these emails and unfortunately I am unable to reply to all of them - that doesn't mean I haven't read your note!
