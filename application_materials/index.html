<h3>Research Summary:</h3>
<div class='well'>
<p>
The goal of my research is to invent methods that enable machines to better understand natural language at scale, and demonstrate the potential for new applications this will enable.  My most significant contributions can be divided into three major thrusts, which are briefly summarized below with links to selected papers:
</p>

<p>
<b>Better Minimally-Supervised Machine Learning for Information Extraction:</b>
Traditional information extraction methods rely on painstaking annotation efforts that are both expensive and time-consuming.  To address this linguistic annotation bottleneck, I have developed new methods that can learn effectively without access to direct human supervision, instead learning from existing structured data, for example Wikipedia or Freebase.  A major challenge, however, is the problem of label noise.  For example, facts that are mentioned in the text but missing in the knowledge base lead to false negatives.  To address this issue, I proposed a novel structured learning approach that incorporates side-information through a missing data model <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q13-1030'>(Ritter et. al. TACL 2013)</a>.  More recently, I extended this approach with learned representations computed using a convolutional neural network that is trained end-to-end as part of a Latent Structured SVM <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00118.pdf'>(Bai and Ritter NAACL 2019)</a>.  By combining the benefits of structured learning and convolutional neural networks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on minimally supervised mention-level relation extraction, using only proposition-level supervision from a KB, without any human annotations.  In addition to developing improved methods for learning from less supervision, I have explored a number of applications of minimally supervised information extraction, for example: automatically updating Wikipedia by learning to extract events from news and social media <a href='https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3038912.3052646'>(Konovalov et. al. WWW 2017)</a> and minimally supervised extraction of cybersecurity events <a href='https://aritter.github.io/twitter_security.pdf'>(Ritter et. al. WWW 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data Driven Conversation:</b>
I was the first to propose data-driven approaches for dialogue generation <a href='https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D11-1054'>(Ritter et. al. EMNLP 2011)</a>, by adapting techniques from statistical machine translation.  This sparked a significant amount of interest and follow-up work.  One practical application is Gmail’s <a href='https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html'>smart reply</a> feature, which uses neural machine translation methods to automatically suggest responses to users’ emails.  A major limitation, however, is that neural dialogue models tend to produce plausible but dull replies in response to almost any input (for example: “I don’t know” or “sounds good”).  In collaboration with other researchers at Stanford and Microsoft Research, I explored a number of approaches to address this challenge including: reinforcement learning to generate responses that maximize the long-term success of conversation <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127'>(Li et. al. EMNLP 2016)</a>, adversarial learning to generate conversations that are more human-like <a href='https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1230'>(Li et. al. EMNLP 2017)</a>, and distributional decoding constraints that encourage neural conversation models to generate more content words and fewer function words <a href='https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1431'>(Baheti et. al. EMNLP 2018)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>New Applications (Social Media, Cybersecurity, and Wet-Lab Protocols):</b>
I was one of the first researchers to recognize the importance of customizing natural language processing methods for social media data.  I developed a set of natural language processing tools adapted to noisy Twitter text <a href='https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D11-1141'>(Ritter et. al. EMNLP 2011)</a>, which have been used extensively by other research groups.  In the meantime, Social Media/Computational Social Science has become a major sub-area within the natural language processing community with dedicated tracks in our main conferences (ACL, EMNLP and NAACL).  I am a founder and organizer of the Workshop on Noisy User-Generated Text (<a href='http://noisy-text.github.io'>W-NUT</a>), an annual workshop that has been held in conjunction with ACL, Coling and EMNLP since 2015.  I have also contributed to new social media analysis applications using natural language processing technology including analyzing online opinions about the severity of new software vulnerabilities reported online <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10680.pdf'>(Zong et. al. NAACL 2019)</a>.  Recently, I initiated a new research direction with the goal of enabling machines to read <a href='http://bionlp.osu.edu:5000/protocols'>Wet Lab Protocols</a> - these can be thought of as cooking recipes for how to conduct biology or chemistry experiments.  As part of this effort I am participating in DARPA's <a href='https://www.darpa.mil/program/accelerated-molecular-discovery'>Accelerated Molecular Design</a> program in collaboration with chemists developing autonomous experiment platforms.
