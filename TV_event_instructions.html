<h1>Guidelines:</h1>

Here are some detailed instructions for the Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT task.
<p>
You will be presented with a tweet with certain information present in it and asked about the author's perspective about events present in the tweet. You will then be asked to make a decision for two questions - the first one deals with author's speculation about the event and has 5 choices <b><em>(Definitely Yes/ Probably Yes/ Author is uncertain about the outcome/ Probably No/ Definitely No)</em></b> and the second one deals with the author's desire towards that event and again, you will be provided with 5 choices <b><em>(Strongly wants the event to happen/ Probably wants the event to happen/ No desire about the event/ Probably does not want the event to happen/ Strongly against the event)</em></b>. <b>You are to assume nothing about these events or use your own knowledge about these events to answer the question. The answer must be based solely on the content of the tweet</b>.
<p>
  
<b>Here is an example</b>:<br>
"Eagles should draft Paxton Lynch instead of Carson Wentz"

In this particular tweet, the author is uncertain about the outcome of whether <b><em>Wentz will be drafted to the Eagles</em></b>. But he/she is against the idea of Wentz getting drafted to the Eagles since he/she wants some other player to be drafted. So, the correct choice for <b>(a)</b> in this case is that <em>the author is uncertain about the outcome</em> and the correct choice for <b>(b)</b> is that the author is <em>strongly against the event</em>.
<p>

<b>Here is another example</b>:<br>
"Single biggest question in the Oscars: Birdman. Could win 1 or 2, could win 6 or 7. Both scenarios are credible. I picked 2; I may be low."
<p>
	<table>
		<tr valign="top">
		<td>			
			<p class="q1"><b>a. </b><em>Based on the tweet above, does <b>the author</b> think that </em></p>
			<p class="q1"><strong>Birdman  is going to win the Oscars for that year?</strong></p>

	</table>  
In this case, the author is speculating that <b><em>Birdman will probably win at least 1 Oscar</em></b>. It also comes across that the author really wants the movie to win an Oscar. So, the correct choice for <b>(a)</b> in this case is the author <em>most probably thinks that</em> the movie will win an Oscar and the correct choice for <b>(b)</b> is that the author <em>strongly wants the event to happen</em>.

Your judgments will be used by researchers worldwide to help advance research on Computational Linguistics.  Participation is voluntary and  you are free to complete as much or as little work as you choose.  You are free to stop participating at any point.  A computer program will compare your answers against a native English speaker and other people's answers.  It is OK to have different answers from other people and make some mistakes; however if you make too many mistakes we will have to reject your answers.  You will be paid US $0.20 per hit you complete. After the study is complete, we will retain your judgments on the data, but replace your Mechanical Turk IDs with anonymized versions.  This research is being funded by the National Science Foundation and conducted at Ohio State.  If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please contact me (Alan Ritter) at ritter.1492@osu.edu.
