<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<div class='well'>
<p>
Much of human knowledge is encoded in text.  This project aims to substantially advance the capability of machines to read large document collections and reason about the knowledge contained within them using minimal human effort.  This will help people to overcome information overload and make better decisions by analyzing vital information that is locked away in unstructured text.  Recent years have seen tremendous progress on tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation, by applying deep learning methods on very large, high quality datasets, however most available datasets for information extraction are either small or very noisy.  To address these challenges, the project will develop new methods that can learn more effectively from large, but noisy datasets that are constructed using distant supervision from an existing knowledge base (KB).  To demonstrate the new methods’ effectiveness, they will be used to support a number of novel applications.  These include the detection of cyber-threats that are reported online and the analysis of experts’ opinions about their severity.  Recent studies have found that 75% of software vulnerabilities are first reported online, giving attackers time to exploit the vulnerability.  Systems that can automatically read computer security blogs and analyze new threats could help security practitioners to track and prioritize them more effectively.
