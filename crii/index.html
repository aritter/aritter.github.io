<h3>Goals:</h3><br>
<div class='well'>
<p>
  The primary objective of the project is to develop methods that accurately extract events that alter properties of knowledge-base entities from realtime text streams. An entity’s properties are frequently affected by events that take place in the world. For example, an election event can change the Leader property of a geo-political entity, or a wedding can change the Spouse of a person. When such events occur, knowledge base contributors often edit properties of affected entities in near-realtime, for instance on Wikipedia. Because the set of these entity-transition-events is large and not fixed, this project proposes, implements and evaluates new models for learning text extractors from naturally occurring KB revisions. As a concrete instance, we are building models that learn event extractors for Twitter using Wikipedia infobox edits as distant (weak) supervision. The methods developed, should be readily applicable to other streaming text sources and timestamped databases.
</p>  

<p>
  Additionally, a critical challenge we have identified for predicting the precise time a knowledge-revision takes place is the sub-task of resolving time expressions, for example “next Friday”, “on the 4th”, to unambiguous calendar dates.  Most previous work in social media analysis has relied on temporal resolvers that are designed for newswire text, for example TempEx or SUTime, and therefore suffer from reduced performance due to domain mismatch. To address this challenge, we have developed a minimally supervised method that learns from large quantities of unlabeled in-domain data and requires no hand-engineered rules or hand-annotated training corpora.
