<div class="panel-body">There are two excellent NLP textbooks that are freely available online.  I will assign readings from both - there is a lot of value in seeing multiple perspectives on the same material.
If a concept you encounter seems confusing at first, try reading about it in the other textbook to get a different perspective.  </div>

  <div class="panel-heading">Grading</div>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      Grading will be based on:

      <h4>Participation (10%)</h4>
      You will receive credit for asking and answering questions related to the homework on Piazza, engaging in class discussion and participating in the in-class exercises.
      
      <h4>Homeworks (50%)</h4>

      The homeworks will include both written and programming assignments.  Homework should be submitted to the Dropbox folder in <a href='https://carmen.osu.edu/'>Carmen</a> by
      11:59pm on the day it is due (unless otherwise instructed).  Each student will have 3 flexible days to turn in late homework throughout the semester.  As an example, you could
      turn in the first homework 2 days late and the second homework 1 day late without any penalty.  After that you will loose 20% for each day the homework is late.
      Please email your homework to the instructor in case there are any technical issues with submission.

      <h4>Midterm (20%)</h4>
      There will be an in-class midterm (the date is TBD).
      
      <h4>Final Projects (20%)</h4>
      The final project is an open-ended assignment, with the goal of gaining experience applying the techniques presented in class to real-world datasets.  
      Students should work in groups of 3-4.  It is a good idea to discuss your planned project with the instructor to get feedback.
      The final project report should be 4 pages.
      The report should describe the problem you are solving, what data is being used, the proposed technique you are applying in addition to
      what baseline is used to compare against.

  <div class="panel-body">
    <list>
      Any assignment or exam that you hand in must be your own work (with the exception of group projects).
      However, talking with others to better understand the material is strongly encouraged.
      Copying a solution or letting someone copy your solution is considered cheating.  Everything you hand in must be
      your own words.  Code you hand in must be written by you, with the exception of any code provided
      as part of the assignment.  Any collaboration during an exam is considered cheating.  Any student who
      is caught cheating will be reported to the Committee on Academic Misconduct.  Please don't take a chance -
      if you are having trouble understanding the material, let us know and we will be happy to help.
